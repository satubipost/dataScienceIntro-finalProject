# Sequence Generation 
### submitted by Daniel & Liora

## Assignment Description
in this assignment we will build a different models for 3 different books and then test our models by trying to classify which book a paragraph is taken from. we will use keras to generate new sequences for each of the different books and then try to classify from which book the generated sequence originiated.

## Data Gathering
we will download our books from [Project Guteberg](https://www.gutenberg.org)


```python
import urllib
import pandas as pd
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk import PorterStemmer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

sherlockFile = 'sherlock.txt'
treasureFile = 'treasure.txt'
princeFile = 'prince.txt'
```


```python
print('Downloading books...')


sherlockUrl = 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/liora/sherlock.txt'  
treasureUrl = 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/liora/treasure.txt'  
princeUrl = 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/liora/prince.txt'  


```

    Downloading books...



```python
#python 2
import urllib, cookielib
downloader = urllib.URLopener()


downloader.retrieve(sherlockUrl, sherlockFile)
downloader.retrieve(treasureUrl, treasureFile)
downloader.retrieve(princeUrl, princeFile)
```




    ('prince.txt', <httplib.HTTPMessage instance at 0x7f81be70b908>)




```python
#python 3
#import urllib.request
#urllib.request.urlretrieve(sherlockUrl, sherlockFile)  
#urllib.request.urlretrieve(treasureUrl, treasureFile)  
#urllib.request.urlretrieve(princeUrl, princeFile)  
```

We will work with 3 different books, we choose those books since they are written by different authors and are of different genres:
* The Prince by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, 1532 (Non-fiction political text)
* The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, 1892 (Detective fiction)
* Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, 1883 (Adventure fiction)

each book contains some meta data from the gutenbern project and publication information, we will first clean it up we will remove the metadata from the books, remove stopwords , leave english characters only and use porter stemming to have a better count of simillar words. then we will count the number of sequences (sentences) in each book.



```python
startIndicator = '*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK'
endIndicator = '*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK'
line_break= "NEWLINE"
def remove_metadata (raw_text):
    temp = raw_text[raw_text.find(startIndicator):raw_text.find(endIndicator)]
    return temp[temp.find(' ***') + 4:]
```


```python
def sequence_to_words( raw ): 
    letters_only = re.sub("[^a-zA-Z\']", " ", raw) 
    words = letters_only.lower().split() 
    stops = set(stopwords.words("english"))                  
    meaningful_words = [w for w in words if not w in stops]
    porter = PorterStemmer()
    meaningful_words = [porter.stem(w) for w in meaningful_words]
    res =  ( " ".join( meaningful_words )) 
    return res
```


```python
sherlock_raw_text = open(sherlockFile).read()
treasure_raw_text = open(treasureFile).read()
prince_raw_text = open(princeFile).read()

sherlock_raw_text = remove_metadata(sherlock_raw_text)
treasure_raw_text = remove_metadata(treasure_raw_text)
prince_raw_text = remove_metadata(prince_raw_text)
```

we will need to clean our inputs. we don't want to have the book contents and other information, to learn the model we would like to have only the book itself. we will remove the unnecessary parts


```python
sherlock_raw_text = sherlock_raw_text[sherlock_raw_text.find('ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA'):]
treasure_raw_text = treasure_raw_text[treasure_raw_text.find('PART ONE--'):] 
prince_raw_text = prince_raw_text[prince_raw_text.find('CHAPTER I -- HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE,'):] 

```

download stopwords package from nltk


```python
#nltk.download()
```

split the text by '.' and count # of sentences - we will later generate 0.3*#ofSentences for each book


```python
sherlock_sequences = sherlock_raw_text.split('.')
treasure_sequences = treasure_raw_text.split('.')
prince_sequences = prince_raw_text.split('.')

sherlock_num_of_sequences = len(sherlock_sequences)
treasure_num_of_sequences = len(treasure_sequences)
prince_num_of_sequences = len(prince_sequences)

sherlock_avg_sentence_length = int (len(sherlock_raw_text) / sherlock_num_of_sequences)
treasure_avg_sentence_length = int (len(treasure_raw_text) / treasure_num_of_sequences)
prince_avg_sentence_length = int (len(prince_raw_text) / prince_num_of_sequences)



print('# of sequences from Sherlock Holmes: ')
print(sherlock_num_of_sequences)
print('# of sequences from Treasure Island: ')
print(treasure_num_of_sequences)
print('# of sequences from The Prince: ')
print(prince_num_of_sequences)

print('avg sentence length from Sherlock Holmes: ')
print(sherlock_avg_sentence_length)
print('avg sentence length from Treasure Island: ')
print(treasure_avg_sentence_length)
print('avg sentence length from The Prince: ')
print(prince_avg_sentence_length)

```

    # of sequences from Sherlock Holmes: 
    6196
    # of sequences from Treasure Island: 
    3295
    # of sequences from The Prince: 
    1180
    avg sentence length from Sherlock Holmes: 
    92
    avg sentence length from Treasure Island: 
    111
    avg sentence length from The Prince: 
    220


define a function to create a dataframe from the list of sentences from each book


```python
def sentences_to_data(sherlock_data, treasure_data, prince_data):
    sherlock_data = [[sequence_to_words(s), 'sherlock'] for s in sherlock_data]
    treasure_data = [[sequence_to_words(s), 'treasure'] for s in treasure_data]
    prince_data = [[sequence_to_words(s), 'prince'] for s in prince_data]
    all_data = sherlock_data + treasure_data + prince_data
    columns = ['sequence', 'book']
    df = pd.DataFrame(all_data, columns=columns)
    return df    
```

we will join the 3 different lists of sequneces into one list which will represent all of our data. we will then build a pandas dataframe from that list that will have 2 columns: the sequence and the book it was taken from. the count vectorizer will build our bag of words by counting occurences and keep the most used featrues. we will improve this model by combining it with tf-idf longer text like sherlock has a higher probability of containing the words in our dictionary and some words are frequent in all text and are not of much use to us.


```python
df = sentences_to_data(sherlock_sequences, treasure_sequences, prince_sequences)
all_cleaned_sequences = df['sequence'].tolist()
```

we will use the Bag of Words model to trasform our cleaned texts into structrued data which can be learned by some model. the vectorizer will create our dictionary.


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
tfidfvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer = "word", \
                                  tokenizer = None, \
                                  ngram_range=(1,3), \
                                  max_features = 7500, \
                                  stop_words = None, \
                                  min_df=1, \
                                  use_idf=True)
tfidf_matrix = tfidfvectorizer.fit_transform(all_cleaned_sequences)

```

## Training A Model for Classification
we will use random forest classifier, split our data into train and test sets and then try to predict the book a sentence was taken from using our model 


```python
msk = np.random.rand(len(df)) < 0.8

train_x = tfidf_matrix[msk]
test_x = tfidf_matrix[~msk]
train_y = df.loc[msk,"book"]
test_y = df.loc[~msk,"book"]
```

we will run a grid search with cross validation in order to get the best parmater tuning for our random forest, we will only tune the parameters we found are most important.


```python
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV

rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1,max_features= 'sqrt' ,n_estimators=50, oob_score = True) 

param_grid = { 
    'n_estimators': [100, 500, 700],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2'],
}

forest = GridSearchCV(estimator=rfc, param_grid=param_grid, cv= 5)
forest.fit( train_x, train_y )
print (forest.best_params_)
forest.score(test_x, test_y)
```

    {'max_features': 'log2', 'n_estimators': 100}





    0.85303662494204913



## Generating New Sequences
we will use keras to create a deep network for each book. we will use our deep networks in order to generate new sequences in the spirit of each book.


```python
import theano
import keras 
from keras import backend as K
K.set_image_dim_ordering('th')

```

    Using Theano backend.


let's check the length of the differnet texts first and examine the texts.


```python
print('sherlock length:', len(sherlock_raw_text))
print('treasure length:', len(treasure_raw_text))
print('prince length:', len(prince_raw_text))
```

    ('sherlock length:', 574575)
    ('treasure length:', 368246)
    ('prince length:', 259945)



```python
sherlock_raw_text[0:1000]
```

we will define a vocabulary of a limited size, words that are not frequent will not be a part of our vocbulary - we will replace them with an UNKOWNTOKEN in the text. since our seqeunces are sentences we will mark the start and end of each sentence so our network will learn how to generate new sentences.


```python
vocabulary_size = 600
#unknown_token = "UNKNOWNTOKEN"
sentence_start_token = "sentencestart"
sentence_end_token = "sentenceend"
#line_break= "NEWLINE"
```

we use aws to run this code - since ec2 runs linux line breaks are represented by '\r\n' for windows pc we will use '\n'


```python
def replace_tokens (text):
    res = text.replace('\r\n',' ')
    #res = res.replace('\n',' ')
    res = res.replace('.',' '+sentence_end_token +' '+ sentence_start_token+' ' )
    return res
```


```python
sherlock_replaced_tokens = replace_tokens(sherlock_raw_text)
sherlock_replaced_tokens[0:1000]

we will split the strings on whitespace and then pass the list of words to the tokenizer


```python
from keras.preprocessing.text import text_to_word_sequence
sherlock_words = text_to_word_sequence(sherlock_replaced_tokens,
                                       lower=True,
                                       filters='!"\'#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\r\n',
                                       split=" ")
treasure_words = text_to_word_sequence(treasure_replaced_tokens, lower=True,
                                       filters='!"\'#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\r\n',
                                       split=" ")

                                       split=" ")
```


```python
sherlock_words[0:10]
```




    ['adventure',
     'i',
     'sentenceend',
     'sentencestart',
     'a',
     'scandal',
     'in',
     'bohemia',
     'i',
     'sentenceend']




```python
treasure_words[0:10]
```




    ['part', 'one', 'the', 'old', 'buccaneer', '1', 'the', 'old', 'sea', 'dog']




```python
prince_words[0:10]
```




    ['chapter',
     'i',
     'how',
     'many',
     'kinds',
     'of',
     'principalities',
     'there',
     'are',
     'and']




```python
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

sherlock_token = Tokenizer(nb_words = vocabulary_size ,char_level=False)
sherlock_token.fit_on_texts(sherlock_words)

treasure_token = Tokenizer(nb_words = vocabulary_size ,char_level=False)
treasure_token.fit_on_texts(treasure_words)

prince_token = Tokenizer(nb_words = vocabulary_size ,char_level=False)
prince_token.fit_on_texts(prince_words)
```

turn the words into one-hot representation after building the vocabulary with the tokenizer


```python
sherlock_mtx = sherlock_token.texts_to_matrix(sherlock_words, mode='binary')
print('sherlock words vector length:', len(sherlock_words))
sherlock_mtx.shape

```

    ('sherlock words vector length:', 118320)





    (118320, 600)




```python
treasure_mtx = treasure_token.texts_to_matrix(treasure_words, mode='binary')
print('treasure words vector length:', len(treasure_words))
treasure_mtx.shape
```

    ('treasure words vector length:', 76715)





    (76715, 600)




```python
prince_mtx = prince_token.texts_to_matrix(prince_words, mode='binary')
print('prince words vector length:', len(prince_words))
prince_mtx.shape
```

    ('prince words vector length:', 47656)





    (47656, 600)




```python
sherlock_vocab = pd.DataFrame({'word':sherlock_words,'code':np.argmax(sherlock_mtx,axis=1)})
sherlock_vocab = sherlock_vocab.drop_duplicates().sort_values('code')
sherlock_vocab.shape
```




    (7895, 2)




```python
treasure_vocab = pd.DataFrame({'word':treasure_words,'code':np.argmax(treasure_mtx,axis=1)})
treasure_vocab = treasure_vocab.drop_duplicates().sort_values('code')
treasure_vocab.shape
```




    (5885, 2)

    (4727, 2)



create input & output matrices, the output will be the input matrix shifted by 1


```python
sherlock_input_ = sherlock_mtx[:-1]
sherlock_output_ = sherlock_mtx[1:]
sherlock_input_.shape, sherlock_output_.shape
```




    ((118319, 600), (118319, 600))




```python
treasure_input_ = treasure_mtx[:-1]
treasure_output_ = treasure_mtx[1:]
treasure_input_.shape, treasure_output_.shape
```




    ((76714, 600), (76714, 600))




```python
prince_input_ = prince_mtx[:-1]
prince_output_ = prince_mtx[1:]
prince_input_.shape, prince_output_.shape
```




    ((47655, 600), (47655, 600))



### Model Training
define model as sequential and build the layers


```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Activation, Flatten
from keras.layers.wrappers import TimeDistributed
from keras.layers.embeddings import Embedding
from keras.layers.recurrent import LSTM
from keras.layers.embeddings import Embedding
from keras.layers.recurrent import SimpleRNN

sherlock_model = Sequential()
sherlock_model.add(Embedding(input_dim = sherlock_input_.shape[1], output_dim= 42, input_length = sherlock_input_.shape[1]))
sherlock_model.add(Flatten())
sherlock_model.add(Dense(sherlock_output_.shape[1], activation='sigmoid'))

treasure_model = Sequential()
treasure_model.add(Embedding(input_dim = treasure_input_.shape[1], output_dim= 42, input_length = treasure_input_.shape[1]))
treasure_model.add(Flatten())
treasure_model.add(Dense(treasure_output_.shape[1], activation='sigmoid'))

prince_model = Sequential()
prince_model.add(Embedding(input_dim = prince_input_.shape[1], output_dim= 42, input_length = prince_input_.shape[1]))
prince_model.add(Flatten())
prince_model.add(Dense(prince_output_.shape[1], activation='sigmoid'))
```

compile the 3 different models, we will use multiclass logloss as a loss function and use  rmsprop optimization


```python
sherlock_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop',metrics=["accuracy"])
treasure_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop',metrics=["accuracy"])
prince_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop',metrics=["accuracy"])
```

now we will train the model, we will use batch_size of 200 (default is 32, larger is better), and 100 epochs


```python
sherlock_model.fit(sherlock_input_, y = sherlock_output_, batch_size = 200, nb_epoch = 5 , verbose = 1, validation_split = 0.2)
```

### Model Evalutaion
we will now evaluate how well our model performs on the 20% of data saved for validation


```python
score = sherlock_model.evaluate(sherlock_input_, sherlock_output_, verbose=0)
score
```




    [3.5823735593051773, 0.18556613899888114]




```python
score = treasure_model.evaluate(treasure_input_, treasure_output_, verbose=0)
score
```




    [3.3052746314377384, 0.17316265609947207]




```python

### Generating new sequences
we will define a function that recives a word and chooses a word from the most probable words based on the vocbulary we built earlier. due to memory limits we limit the sentence length.


```python
def get_next(text,token,model,fullmtx,fullText):
    tmp = text_to_word_sequence(text, lower=False, split=" ")
    tmp = token.texts_to_matrix(tmp, mode='binary')
    p = model.predict(tmp)
    top10 = p.argsort() [0][-10:]
    bestMatch = np.random.choice(top10,1)[0]
    next_idx = np.min(np.where(fullmtx[:,bestMatch]>0))
    return fullText[next_idx]
```


```python
def generateSentences(epochs,token,model,fullMtx,fullText, avg_sen_len):
    output_text = ""
    for i in range(0,epochs-1):
        sentence =""
        word = get_next('SENTENCESTART',token,model,fullMtx,fullText)
        while(len(sentence) < 1 or (word != 'SENTENCEEND' and len(sentence) <= (avg_sen_len - (len(word) + 1)))):
            if (word != 'SENTENCESTART' and word != 'SENTENCEEND'):
                sentence += ' ' + word
            word = get_next(word,token,model,fullMtx,fullText)
        output_text += sentence + '.'
    return output_text
```

generate a list of new senteces for each book. the list size will be 30% from the original number of sentences we trained our model on


```python
sherlock_new_sentences = generateSentences(int(sherlock_num_of_sequences * 0.3),sherlock_token,sherlock_model,sherlock_mtx,sherlock_words, sherlock_avg_sentence_length)
treasure_new_sentences = generateSentences(int(treasure_num_of_sequences * 0.3),treasure_token,treasure_model,treasure_mtx,treasure_words, treasure_avg_sentence_length)
prince_new_sentences = generateSentences(int(prince_num_of_sequences * 0.3),prince_token,prince_model,prince_mtx,prince_words, prince_avg_sentence_length)
```

examine the new sentences and write them to files


```python
sherlock_new_file = open("sherlock_new.txt", "w")
sherlock_new_file.write(sherlock_new_sentences)
sherlock_new_file.close()

sherlock_new_sentences
```

door of those of it seemed. you may sentenceend with you can get the ground in this gentleman to me with which it must. then sentenceend with him and then the same that i have seen a small and i could and yet. holmes answered me for the window sentenceend sentencestart you sentenceend which it and to. then he spoke in one sentenceend sentenceend and a very well i thought that there a man. i could see it to see a week and now then suddenly and that this fellow and then the table. and then the corner that this is a very interesting of those sentenceend with my wife of. it sentenceend with him as i should hear to the city of her sister and then you can imagine. there was in one or else had a woman the window we went and then and yet which it must turn. you have seen a cab for a cab which were in front with your father s not think of it and. holmes as far to my stepfather sentenceend which are very quick for a few words of my. you must sentenceend to him sentenceend of this gentleman to have done of her sister s room. and i think it would be at me to see you are all i thought the other people sentenceend. then it was at his father had come with him when she could and he answered of those and i. you are you will you may of course i have had left me with my wife in my own that i should. but i found and i should be a man was not go and that she will you know how did and now let. holmes answered me in one of those letters for the door sentenceend for me sentenceend. you to him for it sentenceend that this hat in the corner for me in front sentenceend that. you to have done and now i thought that he could be the matter of course sentenceend with. you must go in which it sentenceend to be married of a woman in the windows and the door. holmes and his chair up from the same for us that there and his face with a man or a week. i had gone so far in his hand to him for it and that i could only chance of my father i. i think that you must of a woman the same sentenceend for you know where to a few of his. holmes the ground for my stepfather s the other as the other in the table he answered. but i found in an opinion of his hands with my friend sentenceend to him as we have the. and yet and his face the windows to do it was a long and that is the same that is not be in. the matter was to be of those in an sentenceend of this is not a long of my heart for he. there can see me but i thought of my father was to my sister but he has not a few years at. you must put in the windows and a few in a very peculiar at my father sentenceend and to do. holmes as much to do not have given which i am to see that you must and then and the table. it was at once of them at his own and that she does in order of them from it to be at the. i should you may be a woman for my companion which is very peculiar that the windows were a. but a small in which it would do sentenceend for i am not have no sentenceend with me for. and the matter sentenceend and his father and i found ourselves at his face sentenceend. he said i am very peculiar that the windows as far for us talk to the door was to see him. then the other in front of my companion and yet you must have given her and to see what you. it would of my heart with me but it sentenceend which were and the windows and that she was. then what did to my father at all right of a week of the matter was at his hand upon my. i was in front room at last which is not know sentenceend with a woman of course that is. the door to you can get in an end of my companion for some sort that we have given me with. you see sentenceend that you know where to see the windows to him to the corner in his hand. it to my hand and the other people for me for us with my sister of my dear that it was in. you must have been in my heart and a woman s earth with her own of his hands with him that. i shall be married to do with a long thin with a cab as the corner to me sentenceend for i. and his head and his face with her to him as to him and a long sentenceend sentenceend to. i have done of course the matter sentenceend sentenceend that is the windows to have the. you can imagine that you will leave and then sentenceend and that this is not only to my. holmes answered to my sister was only daughter to me with the door was not a woman the. he has sentenceend to the door to you can get at all day i had the window and his father. it is very likely to me the table sentenceend of it is very peculiar to you must of her to. there s business at a man to do i could only just to be able which was to the ground which. it seems sentenceend in front room which it sentenceend of his pocket of it is my wife and. holmes answered sentenceend in order of those letters to be at last night sentenceend which. it must and that i am sure for i am not know what the ground that he would bring of my. the matter was no sign that i have the windows for the windows for a few minutes. i was only one sentenceend with you sentenceend sentencestart the windows of my own for us. then the city at once for me as he has the window to have you know and the ground as much. he said and i have no more and the ground of this case to him for my own of this case to me. there are not been given which i should like that it seemed a man s a few sentenceend of. and to me and the windows to me that the matter but there was a long thin and to my dear. and he answered to be sentenceend sentenceend sentencestart he had the door behind to do i. there was at last he would bring to him and his hand upon it was not go into the windows in. holmes the other sentenceend and now of course i found sentenceend of this fellow that. it is very quick at last and to you must turn and that he was very well and a little. there a very peculiar of my sister with his father at the corner for me with him with your. then that it was at last night it was at last he would do with which i was the table to. holmes answered sentenceend sentenceend that he has turned down with her but how he has. the door behind and the table to a very sentenceend in this morning and now for my father. holmes sentenceend for he was at least which it is very quietly which had been drawn and a. holmes i should sentenceend for some sort for a few to the city sentenceend sentenceend for. then that we could only one side in order that i have a woman in this fellow with your. and now sentenceend sentenceend sentencestart holmes the corner with you see that this. and to be at the ground of a woman in which he sentenceend and to see it to the table. but i shall have given which you know of her sentenceend sentencestart then the windows and. and now i have had been a few words it is to a cab sentenceend for you know all the matter. there are the windows with his eyes and a cab to me sentenceend and to my own for my own of. i have given me the door behind a cab with which was very peculiar at me sentenceend in one. but what the corner that i could you will have given of my friend and yet to see him that. i shall see that you have already and yet sentenceend that he is a large sentenceend in. holmes in my companion with which was the matter was the same and that there a little more. but what you see sentenceend to you are all right of course sentenceend of them at me as. you will not go for you can imagine from home a very much in this hat with his eyes as much. you know what is very sentenceend which you may i could you have the other was so far which. you see what is no idea of those who it and then what was very quick in his hands upon your. it was very much the windows and his hands and the matter of them from it would be at me. then it sentenceend that is to have been of course of it would of his pocket which i have. the city and now i was very interesting sentenceend and a very much more and to him as a. and that is the door and i could it must leave and then the same to the window we had. but how i was so that we have already to have a cab of this gentleman of the city to me. holmes answered sentenceend of those and i think sentenceend of my stepfather and i shall. and he spoke and yet there and yet of her and his face sentenceend which are the matter. and a long sentenceend and he has already at his son for you know that it s room which are. but a week at last night in one of his eyes to my companion of those and now that is that. he sentenceend sentencestart he would bring him to do with his chair in his hand to my. he could it seemed and a cab with my companion with his hand upon a small which you are. he would take of those letters upon him to do nothing remarkable for some strange of the. it to the city to my father sentenceend and to him a man in his head with your father to my. holmes that we went and to a small that you are not only chance and yet and to you to me. and i should i had the windows were to a long to the window and the same in an sentenceend. there a very good day and yet of those in order which it would sentenceend and that he. then it sentenceend for me as far that the other side and to me to a long as a little of. but he answered of her but it would give to him for i had seen a little sentenceend for my. i was a very well i thought i should have a week and to be at me for it seems sentenceend. the corner that this gentleman to him when we have a large and to him with a week to my. i thought at the same in his own to me to him and now let us and i should not be able with. it was very quietly with his face which you can t you have already to a man to a small that. i am a man or to the corner of his pocket of those letters sentenceend which were all that. it seems upon me for me sentenceend and to me the ground that he said sentenceend that you. then what is the matter sentenceend for me and then and a few days of the matter in which. the corner of her that it was no sir and his hands in his head that she would of the door. you sentenceend of course in which are to you can see him sentenceend with my friend in his. he was only by which you must go of it to have been to be able with the table of a few. it and then and now i could be married for he is no no one and a few of my father but there. there a cab with the same of his own in this case of them and then you know of a woman with. the window i could i found as far from home in which you may take you can get and that i am. the window we were no no one which the table he had seen a man and the corner with him that. holmes sentenceend sentenceend that this morning but as he was the table with her that we. holmes i am sentenceend of his head of it was no i am not a woman s sentenceend which it. you see you sentenceend sentenceend to have a small to my friend with him that he answered. i should not to my stepfather mr which you are a large of a week s sentenceend for my heart. holmes answered of his pocket to have been cut in a man in my dear fellow said she will you. but i was no i am very interesting at last night to have a woman whose at his chair and the. but as the window is my friend in a few years to have given of this way i shall be at all. and that this fellow with a cab as he answered but a week with my wife s house at all the. i shall sentenceend for my sister was in this matter of those of those in one side to do it. the window of the windows which was to have given of a man in one sentenceend for you may i. and now then suddenly of those sentenceend in front to have given sentenceend sentencestart. but there and a very peculiar which had seen by one and his head with me sentenceend. it would take sentenceend that this hat with his head and to my sister which you will of. but there are a cab of a long for he has sentenceend for it s death which were all day to. he could have been drawn and yet to do it seems from one hand at last of this hat upon. the same sentenceend to have you to the ground sentenceend with her to him when the matter. and yet sentenceend sentenceend of a week to have given her and he is not been able in this. it sentenceend for my companion of course and then you are so we had come back into the. holmes as we went for us to the same as he could have a few hours and yet it sentenceend. holmes as much to the table to the same which is the window is quite a large of her. you can you can t it seems in his pocket and i could you must put it was only in a woman. he answered me to be the windows which was a man and i should i think watson that there he. holmes and now i shall be at the window was in an end and he answered and yet which the. you must be the table was in his hand upon which had written and the ground in a week which. there was a man and he is the table which was at last that the same as he was very much and. i should i think you to me sentenceend of this matter up my father at least of her husband. it seemed with a little too for the window in one day before sentenceend which is no doubt. and he was only one side sentenceend in one or a few hours for it to a large to me in an of. holmes as a cab which are all sentenceend for you will sentenceend that he was the windows. the other hand side for my hand at all i think to do not know of my companion s earth to. the city and that we went off of her to do not a cab with which had come at the door was so. he would have been to have seen in a week to be sentenceend for you have had the same and i. the matter sentenceend sentencestart the ground and to have given you sentenceend in which. but a little too for us to do not sentenceend that the matter sentenceend in his head to be. and then i am sure and that i have you may have you can hardly from his father was not to. but it s death which you can see it sentenceend for he sentenceend with your case is not. but as i should sentenceend with a cab by a small t mind and yet i have you can sentenceend. then he is a little to a man and yet i was not been given for you will leave a few words to. there a week in this hat of those who had not only chance at least in this hat in front for. i found sentenceend with the same with a week and to you sentenceend and now and now that. he is in his hands my companion with the table he was not been taken of my hand sentenceend. but it would not sentenceend which was a man or sentenceend and yet the ground to him when. there is quite a little more than once but it to a small t a few sentenceend and a large in. and the window sentenceend for some of her to see him that it and his hands upon him and. but there sentenceend and that i had gone with my dear in order and his chair of his eyes. he would be a week for a man or in the other side for some sort of course for the door in. the windows in an advertisement at my heart with a long time to me for the matter was not. holmes in his chair the ground for us with the matter was not have had the window i had a. but there can hardly of those sentenceend in my own little of the matter to do nothing but. i thought sentenceend of her sentenceend in which had gone to a few hours and now that you. and that we shall sentenceend in which it is the table which had a long silence which are. i should i am to me as far that we are you sentenceend in my dear in one hand and to him as. the ground which was a long thin upon me sentenceend that he sentenceend of course the. and he answered me to you sentenceend and that there were no doubt of my stepfather. it is a small t of my stepfather as to see him sentenceend to me with him as you can see me. but i had been able which he is to my heart

a man of this i know his. he will consider it and as is a prince can be found himself to have done of these things of france sentenceend sentencestart he who had the state is to hold it may have had he should wish in all others and the state by. therefore they do and not fail of their former of them in our times when you will always sentenceend the nobles the church and not know that which have no of their own citizens a prince to make this i believe and it was. i shall by his army in our times a very and to make them but let us come of his own citizens have done to the king he had no more powerful of which is no use and not have done great a new prince so that they should it. the church but it is a prince so to keep the church by one cannot to be found the first and if the other which the state and if his enemies to the prince ought to keep it is the duke di them because the state the church. chapter to hold to him with him the church of others would be the people sentenceend for this reason they were great a man ought never have not the kingdom to have a way they were kept sentenceend to have need of which. but if it has acquired them as the prince sentenceend in his state to the duke sentenceend the other of these things he will not to his people to be more powerful as if his state that he would in their captains and to. the nobles ought he had not know how sentenceend in the king because in their states a new but in order for his enemies they have made them he ought sentenceend to fear from these states a time it was his enemies in. he has not know it and in such princes sentenceend from being all that the king had acquired sentenceend from the church with a private but he who were always need for the other from them but if in all his own or other. he should he has not the nobles of a most by their own sentenceend of a time they should find the church but the king to the kingdom sentenceend from their men who has only those of france would in such men to be found. the first who has been seen as to make war with his people and as a new to hold that the nobles ought with them because in our of his people of france sentenceend and not being in his own forces he would always be so to. the other hand the first sentenceend for a very to keep a private by them to hold to hold the state which it may sentenceend for a prince of them but in the nobles he should have to him that he can they do so great that. the state because you are never sentenceend to make the nobles sentenceend them the king louis to his actions because men of their government the nobles but because the people in italy sentenceend and the prince should. and they did so to him and as it were always the church with their government the prince can and he was his son that are of which the kingdom for a prince ought with them but they will make the people for him with what. therefore if you cannot nor did they did sentenceend of them because that it will see of which will not be a private of france was a time the kingdom sentenceend and if you sentenceend for this is ruined but the other. the people in our to his men sentenceend in a time are of the prince sentenceend them all their country he was necessary that they should not be able they should wish and if one is necessary to keep his actions in all. it will see they were great a time and the state which it sentenceend from the church sentenceend the state is a private but in such principalities of their states which is a wise that a private that which is nothing. for this reason of this one has more necessary for they did that she of the duke di sentenceend the state is the first place for his friends who have the nobles he ought above that he would in all of these two to take. and not to take such men and as to take them because the nobles but the kingdom to his subjects are acquired sentenceend the first to have done by force to fear in a time to have no of france sentenceend from this is a. therefore if you sentenceend to the state that are in his son with difficulty in italy in italy to take care and to be called of others i believe by those for the nobles but the church to his actions for it may. for long a wise because they have not know it would become the church but to hold to fear that of the king of them because of them the nobles sentenceend sentenceend sentencestart i wish he would not to be more of these. he should find by their states the first to be more powerful in all that they had their country for they were compelled the state of others or to hold that a time of the state to hold to take them the first and he was. but the duke sentenceend sentencestart for many others sentenceend the king had a most and as the king to him with which they did not only to make this one should be found and they will see they will see his friends as. this that they had no other and to the kingdom because of others for he can rely and if one cannot stand with them all things were in their soldiers and in this subject but it is very of which they will be called a new. and not have need sentenceend the nobles but they do you cannot defend sentenceend from being entirely on this they will never to him who are acquired the duke of their ruin to his actions of this one who does of which. it may and he would and not fail the people he will never was born with a time the people sentenceend for this that she was his actions because there was a prince should it were compelled sentenceend to hold their. and if his son sentenceend of this one will always the people because that which he did not have made him that a man in the duke with their captains but they do the people or by one of others he did so he will make use. but they did he can he who has to make war with his people sentenceend to take such things to take in all their former in this they do this was able he ought the people sentenceend of them as is to have the kingdom of. he has to take in italy has the first is to the kingdom his state and as the people in order and not being well armed with them sentenceend sentenceend and if his son the people and it has acquired as to keep those men. for they are the king in their country one by force sentenceend and the people are of others that he would and in a way he ought not to make use by the church he can have made some in order of others but in order to be. i will always have been long because of which i consider with a prince of others but he has only sentenceend and not to the prince should he would have made him for it may of france because it was not having his enemies. chapter that she and to hold his actions for this he has always have had a new prince should be so long sentenceend to his state sentenceend of his men sentenceend for many and the first time to the duke had the kingdom. i say that she in such methods to keep it will have had been considered to fear in italy for the kingdom because in his actions to his men have to his son that in italy he has only necessary that of france for many and. for he did this he who does one can he would and they have not only when it has around and if it were brought into all other and they should find a very for they did in italy this they will see them as a new order with. therefore they should wish that of which will have made them because of which it has acquired sentenceend of france to keep it may with him to make the nobles ought sentenceend from these sentenceend sentenceend to fear. and he should they can be the first of the other from these the people to the kingdom in a few by the nobles to him so and the duke of their government the king he has not know it sentenceend to fear from their ruin the. chapter by one by one will not only those who had to the state sentenceend sentenceend of which i shall by those who does it will find and although they have need not only sentenceend the first and it is a way you and. it were in their prince sentenceend sentencestart this they had their ruin of france was in all the church but he ought above of france in italy this was in their own arms in italy sentenceend of others would not fail. chapter that of which he can he who by those states which i sentenceend to be a private to take away with great and the king he will make a most for this reason they do and not only are found them in order in his people. but in such methods sentenceend sentencestart for this is no longer of which he was a few and as a man and to have been the duke and to his army in our the state is a way he will not have done in our times when those. the prince should take care of this he can be considered he should he had he ought with a few who does not being all things were the king he had a most of this subject in their country sentenceend to the duke di them. but let any of their ruin them but they should wish for long sentenceend of them and it would be considered in his actions in italy in our and not know of them all of a time it would have to fear to take such a new ones. chapter sentenceend for long in their former with them to take in the first is to have to him who by him in this he was sent sentenceend sentenceend and in italy he ought in a few and in our by those of which will see. this was the prince of the prince is necessary because of them in all others for him for it will always find and not to him the king sentenceend sentencestart the state of the state and it may not being considered. the other by him in his army a most to take up and to make it sentenceend sentencestart but let a wise sentenceend for he would sentenceend sentenceend for this they should have the prince can easily that of his enemies. but they should have a few had been discussed sentenceend in all men who had made the state that they have not be a new but he will see it were kept and to hold him to hold them in order for a very for he has acquired. for they were of these states of their own will only the prince to take from being well in italy which it has to keep an example in italy has acquired as a most in their captains sentenceend and in his subjects from his. this they would have been and it would be called sentenceend of france for they do so many of which i wish sentenceend sentenceend the state and they can have made himself in such a time he had no longer that the first. i wish for a very of his people or fortune for he did in italy sentenceend and if they do you to his friends sentenceend for long in their soldiers than by him the king he had not only to him in italy has only of others. he should take the prince so to take away sentenceend sentenceend to have had no to him the duke di them as it will see that in his people or they had their own and it has to have not to take away sentenceend. for him the state and in italy for him who has only sentenceend them all his army was necessary because of a way the nobles sentenceend them because in his people because it were in our the church which they are and as. it will make a prince should wish would sentenceend them in italy sentenceend the state by those men and if only to be a very in italy with them sentenceend for it was in the nobles and they were great things and the. he will see and as the nobles to have no and he had the people for long to the church was born a man will find and they will always of their men at one by his enemies of this reason he can do the prince who by his. and it will see them but if he had acquired the duke of these arms he ought in this they will make them because the first in this he has acquired in our of which are the state is not being well and they are so well and. therefore they had no to have no more easily in italy to be able of them to fear at hand because they have to the other to make use with the other that of others that the church which the duke s in a few but the king to. this reason the people in his army of which they will make him with the church sentenceend the duke had to take in his state is very by force and it has always of others he did this he will make him with his own ability. chapter and it to be considered he did in our times in a man in his men and in our sentenceend them the people are and as a wise because he should know that are found them because you are so as the duke with which it. and if they would have the kingdom for the state the first time to make a way they did so long for they are of france in the state sentenceend them to the other things for long a most sentenceend the nobles ought. i wish sentenceend in the nobles you are in such methods for it were kept with his son by a wise he who has acquired them as if they did and it would in his men have the prince so he ought with a time sentenceend for. and the church to his own ability they have a way in order that are the first case one can rely and the nobles ought always sentenceend of others but let them but if only when the state is necessary to the other which. and he would have a new one should he was necessary because of others sentenceend for his army sentenceend them to have done sentenceend from his son that they did not wish for a man and to him in his friends there for. the first who have no more necessary for the church which have not fail to take the first is to fear but it to fear in our with them and it will be done to be able all other and if in our times of the state the king he. and if he ought the state is the nobles to take away their soldiers sentenceend to have need for they would be the other and they can easily and he was in his men of them but he who were compelled for this he should. he ought he was born a new prince sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend from being at any sentenceend of the first case with a time and if the duke s sentenceend of his enemies all those things he did this man will. he would become his actions have not know they can they should wish he should find and he would never and he did the prince so that they had made his own sentenceend from being hated of his subjects to the people of. for this they do not have to keep his people in the duke he did not the first is that which will always sentenceend sentenceend from his own to his army a wise and if his subjects that are found so great in italy and. and as a very necessary therefore the king he was his people to have a private that they had no of these states for him for a man the duke of the kingdom in this was his men in their prince sentenceend them but because. therefore a way sentenceend for it to be called to fear of the king and in their own or if any and he ought he would and not only to make use all the church which are so and as happened for many other things for him to. this man in our by force sentenceend them sentenceend the first and as happened because he should it were great but let sentenceend sentencestart but it has the duke sentenceend and the other things which will only are. the other sentenceend sentenceend the nobles but it will see he who does one of these arms in this he had a man and it to have need he will have a few but to the church to have done and not being an to him so that of. the duke di for he can and as he should wish and to make him who has not to be so as a wise to him the church sentenceend and although sentenceend in order the prince and as is ruined sentenceend in italy and to take up. i shall of france because there in order in the king sentenceend them but to him in our in the other which they can he was born for the duke di by force them in his army he would and he had he had been raised. but he had made them because in the kingdom of the other to the nobles of which will never and if his people in this they did in italy this they can be called in a most of their own laws the nobles of them all of their. and the king had he who are found so great ability they should take up his enemies all things as happened in the nobles ought above sentenceend them he will never sentenceend of his people in the prince sentenceend them. the prince and if you are never so many of them the kingdom sentenceend sentenceend and although one of these factions and as a most and it sentenceend sentenceend in all others i know of them but when they would and. the kingdom and not being well and not having his men sentenceend from him so and he should wish that she has always of others or by one of a way you to be called of this man sentenceend for his state and in all others. this one s for a most sentenceend to fear at once it was a man to take from him to hold their states which will never be able of his own citizens and in a few to have been long a new prince should know of the other and. for the duke he who was his actions sentenceend sentencestart he ought sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend from them sentenceend them as it and he can to take in the nobles ought not wish and not be the first in order. and in all of france in a prince sentenceend in his son the church was a new ones in his own or not wish it sentenceend in italy has made a way he was born with great in a prince ought not wish sentenceend of them. chapter the people he did this one of the king louis by his people for it sentenceend the nobles you do it would never and as to have to him sentenceend them and if only are of which are the state of which are acquired. for a prince is no of others he was sent and if he did sentenceend and he ought with his actions of them and if he who are never been considered a private for they have the first place and although he should they do. and it and it may and the king had not the state and in all that the kingdom his men who have to hold their prince should he did this reason of these states a few sentenceend for this i say that the king because he had. for it is the state the state because there and they do not to be called of a wise because you are and in this i will find and the first time are in the duke in our sentenceend for he will never sentenceend to fear him. but let to the other of his actions but in such and he ought always to be the prince and as i know they will not fail the state because of which they did they should they have a new principalities which are in all those. therefore a way he ought in such as he did in a very by his subjects from his own arms he can only was necessary and although one will find him in his enemies all other by these things to him to take them in our times. it and the king of them he should they can rely for many more difficult to him who have not know of a prince who are the nobles to have not fail the other of this that he should wish it to take the kingdom his state. the nobles you do you sentenceend the people are and to the state by force the state because you to take the nobles to his state the nobles ought always of others and they can easily and to the king to be found the. for this he will make himself so long to hold them the king who was his son that it will only sentenceend of these factions for it was able to him who have had no one s own to the prince of france from his friends in. but he did in the king in such as he would in a few and the duke of them but he was necessary sentenceend in their states the duke s sentenceend from these factions of their prince of which it and he did the other. the church and not having been and in italy in our time he would in this one cannot by those which it were in their former with him to make himself the state by their country he ought the king louis and the people of. he who by his enemies and it would never have no other and he will have to keep a man ought sentenceend and he had acquired sentenceend of a private in their men in order for his state of his state and it would not be. for they do them as they can they were always have done all of this reason that a man as is very sentenceend of this he would be so that the church was not to have need sentenceend them because you for his actions to. but in the prince ought always have no and the nobles of others have been considered the church sentenceend of the duke of his son of his people sentenceend in the nobles he should find the church to make the prince and. for he had their country for a new as to his subjects the prince ought in a wise because the king of their soldiers but when one will never so and although a very by them sentenceend and they should they do well as to. for this subject sentenceend to take in such methods to be considered to take the people or other and not to keep a most sentenceend and they would in italy in italy this was able he had he should find himself to keep. the people to the state which i will consider the nobles the nobles ought sentenceend the first of the people of them the people he had been in their country and it were compelled and to his own forces because it is. for they have not be called at once the nobles you are and they are found so he was able with the duke in our and although and in our by one can be done sentenceend from them in italy for many in their men of which are. this he has acquired in their soldiers than he can they are of which a most by these princes in their government and it were not the church he ought in their states in their captains sentenceend for many in our time he. i do it was his friends the first of france to have made them all those of them the first who are in all those for his state sentenceend sentencestart it were great sentenceend and it and as to be found to be seen to. for many and it has acquired are not be done great that are acquired and he will have made a very for a few to his own to take up in their captains sentenceend in order in their states of france the king in italy he. it to the kingdom many and if you and to have to keep those states for many others or a very to the people of others sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend and in the church was one s of france because you and to him for. the people or a private but he had no one is ruined of france to have need with them he can only to take up with what sentenceend of the prince to hold that a new sentenceend sentencestart the nobles to have the church. chapter the nobles sentenceend the duke in their men when those for a few he was not know to take from these sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend from them the kingdom as it was born with the duke in our of his enemies. this was born but they were kept with a prince is necessary because there and they will always have been discussed sentenceend them all others he did the kingdom sentenceend from this reason to the kingdom sentenceend. chapter to him to be so as to make war is a wise himself with a way sentenceend the prince is that the church he did not fail to fear them all other hand because the nobles he ought always to fear of france and although. this is a private but he can he can be able in this is to have done and to keep the church of which it has more to fear the prince is ruined for many of this that a wise himself to his subjects are found in italy which. and to be the people sentenceend from the first sentenceend them as the kingdom as to take any for many years before him with what and it sentenceend sentencestart i believe with his men at any one cannot defend to his. for this reason sentenceend of them in his enemies sentenceend of the kingdom for him that it has more and to fear but let to have no to the prince to hold of this was one has the other from this that which will. and as i believe to have not know that in italy to his friends of the nobles you cannot defend them the nobles sentenceend for this that she is very sentenceend and as happened the first is that it is no other of these. therefore it was the king who in the duke sentenceend to him and not be a private that in the people and if one of others for him sentenceend to have had their government sentenceend of which they do so to have made. this man as to keep an army in his actions but to him to hold of a prince who had he had been seen in all other from the people of which it would not the kingdom and they are acquired either with a new principalities of. this man ought in all the kingdom for it may and they were in our and the other which a private to him with great the duke of them in a time and they did the state of others but it was born but if it has around of. therefore as happened that a wise because men at his army and it is not having always need and as is necessary that it is nothing so as a very of france sentenceend of the duke of others but let us to hold it were of. but in his subjects that she is the king sentenceend for his friends to have had a new but let it was born for they will be so and in order in the people because it will only of a few and they will only necessary for he. i have not to keep faith for it would sentenceend from his army and to fear of others but it is nothing so well and they have been raised in all things to take them but because men have done all that are never in order. for this reason they do you and to the kingdom many in all of which they did and if only those for they should wish in all things of this they have been in their government being able and the people are never to keep to. and he would in their soldiers from those they have no more of a very to his men sentenceend from the nobles he will never been the king and as i do so well sentenceend in his enemies for the nobles to his enemies or. for they did he will consider it were brought into his state that are in a new but they would never to him with which have no more difficult with a way they would in this that they will have done for a prince should he. this reason a time in italy sentenceend of this was not have no and he has more of these principalities there were in all those to be more difficult as they can to him so great things which have had the prince of these. therefore it will see the first and the first who by them in such princes to fear that of them and they are acquired in order of france because in italy to hold them sentenceend to the prince sentenceend for many men in. it is a time sentenceend and they would to the duke in their men of their men have been able by their soldiers or by him sentenceend of these princes in their prince and if he did that of their men have a prince who has. this was born of them but let any and not know of a way and if they were in his state sentenceend for this reason that he did he would in all their government or they would to be done great men have done to his friends. this is no use with his army a very for him the church by one s and it is not know to make him for long a most with what should take care with what should wish in the prince to be done sentenceend of his people to have. this is a wise to the duke and if his friends sentenceend and the kingdom in all of his friends sentenceend of their former by one by the other from being well known in the kingdom to take care the nobles but let him. he ought always with him in our time are found and as it is ruined and not having a time sentenceend the king sentenceend from his friends in order that in a very short time they would be called in the people because he. for it were always in all the church by those which are acquired as it may to have need to keep to take away and as they would in this i believe the duke s the state and not having always have no and not having in this. it has more difficult for a man the first sentenceend the first time sentenceend sentencestart i say to have to the nobles of their former sentenceend them as he was not be found them sentenceend and if his enemies of. and he was one cannot and the prince of which a most that are found sentenceend of a few but when every other hand the nobles ought always the other hand the church with his enemies of his army with them sentenceend in. this he had he ought to have done of others for him that the king of france because you for this i consider and the church he was sent of others or else of their men at arms for it sentenceend and to hold sentenceend to. but in all that a way and they do them the kingdom many more by these princes of this is a man of france for they do the other hand the kingdom in all men have done all things to him for it to him sentenceend for many. the nobles to fear at the people or a private with the first is ruined with their captains for many have had he did so he should find them as it to make him for they are the duke with him the people of which a wise of. this man sentenceend for many have made him to be a man who had not only those to his enemies all others he had acquired as they did the king who has more of this they are and not know of others or the people are never. but they will not be called a very sentenceend for many in all the state by his own citizens or a very necessary and not wish that he had he ought to his enemies to hold the kingdom in their captains with their prince. he was necessary as the nobles and as they should know and the nobles the king to have no of their ruin in this that he will never been discussed to make and as if you and in his own citizens or a most to the king in. chapter with him in such men have a prince can do not know they would to fear them he had the kingdom for they will only to his own or by their own sentenceend them because it is no one s with great that a prince can. chapter to make this is ruined and as a new prince and he should take such principalities and they were they had no longer a new as he ought the other of others have to fear but because the church of france for many. i have been raised it would be so many others sentenceend sentencestart but if any and he would always with which he will consider it sentenceend to fear the state because you for they can and in the first place with. therefore to the duke did so well and not the first of which is ruined of others he did the king of france because it will consider that she had the other things as if only those for his enemies they had acquired in. it and in such and not to hold it to fear that are not having first to make and to fear of his enemies they should wish in all other from the first place in italy with their captains in our and not have no to hold him. i will consider with great men who does one who was a prince can and to take any other from these states are found in all their government the duke sentenceend them because in their own arms in a few who is very and to. i know how they are the church with them sentenceend for he has only sentenceend sentencestart therefore they have the kingdom sentenceend for him for it to his men to take in a very sentenceend in their states a very. for the duke of france would in his state by them he would to fear them to keep faith sentenceend them all of their government to the other to be more than to take away to him sentenceend and it will never be called him. chapter and the kingdom because there sentenceend the first sentenceend sentenceend to hold them the state that they have no one of which the other that he was a man as the kingdom sentenceend to keep them as if one of. it is not be called of the people for it may sentenceend them he ought sentenceend from a very in such methods which is not fail and it has only to him to have not having first case and not be so as is to the first to. therefore they do it will only to fear in italy has acquired are either for it sentenceend the nobles he was not fail to make them all other by force for him with him the church by his actions because that it to hold. but they had made himself and the duke and he can to keep the state the church he who is a wise he did in our with him so great that she ought not have no sentenceend for they have need and it was one by a few he can he. but let him with great sentenceend for him for the first time in order sentenceend and they are not fail sentenceend of france from the king sentenceend to be so to be found in order and as a private of these things for. for a prince so well sentenceend for the nobles ought the prince can he has the other by one should take a time are never and not wish that they were always sentenceend and if in all others that it were of a prince. therefore it may with their former from these princes are found and not only when he has to the people and the church which is the church of the prince is that it and in such greatness sentenceend of france from a very. but it would become his state of them to be so that are and they were compelled sentenceend from their prince should find sentenceend in our to hold of his actions for this reason he should know to make them the prince. the people to him so well for him who have the duke he who was his actions for many years he can only sentenceend of the people and in this was his son sentenceend them and to make them in order sentenceend of these. chapter of others that in the other that it would and as it sentenceend sentencestart and they are not fail the nobles you for it would become one by their own citizens of the state by one has only sentenceend to keep. i shall and it was in a most in order sentenceend them in such greatness and to have the state because that which is nothing but they are of a prince can they would in our sentenceend in this one has been raised for. but he ought in a prince sentenceend for many men of them he has made the king in their ruin of others sentenceend sentencestart chapter with him for the other from his son to the state is no sentenceend sentencestart. it to him to hold him sentenceend sentenceend for it and as to keep it sentenceend sentencestart it would never or a time sentenceend of france from these things to hold them sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend them. and not have made his enemies sentenceend of the king sentenceend for many and if his son of his son by him with them all men in their ruin and as i consider of their government for him and as it is no use in the church. therefore the first place he should find the first to have need with difficulty for his army sentenceend from these principalities and in our and not wish would to keep faith to him for it sentenceend of a wise to be. he who have made some one who were the church of their captains but in italy with a new prince sentenceend for he should wish for he did sentenceend in his army to be found them to hold the prince who were always to. chapter of others have to keep the king who in a new principality cannot defend himself and they had a few but because the people for he ought he did this i do so great that in a most by them as the church was not. chapter for his men of france because men and in his enemies for it and in italy for they have a very for the other by the other of this man will not wish that in their states that they did sentenceend for it is. for a private that she of them as a new principalities which they have made the state which i will see the state which have the kingdom sentenceend from being entirely sentenceend and as a private by a very and it. and although one should have not to hold him who does and it may not fail to hold them and not only when he has not having no more or by one cannot and it were of others and although he did sentenceend of a time. i sentenceend and if his own and the state that the state by his enemies they would to be seen the other by them in order and it may not have to have need of a wise and if you may with their states of this was not have. this i have a very by those which he will have the other sentenceend sentencestart but they will have to keep to him to take away by them all the prince sentenceend sentencestart therefore a few of them as to be. i believe for he has always be seen and not only necessary that which it was not be done in his people to him so he will never sentenceend sentenceend the people or if any of a very necessary for this is a private by. therefore your by those whom he has to hold him the other things he should they should it to have the people in all those things as a wise to his state of the prince can have made some in their men who were great and. it and as he should it will find that he will see them he will consider those whom i shall sentenceend from this was born but when the first and the nobles for him with difficulty for his friends to him who by their. therefore they should wish for the duke in italy he who in italy and the kingdom his own and in their country and not wish of the king who by one is necessary as the duke s the prince should he has always find the duke. he had made a few had made war sentenceend from these factions for long have a wise of his friends who are of these sentenceend and they did he would not to keep them in their government the other to take from being an. chapter that it will consider and to the prince is not only sentenceend of the nobles of them all men sentenceend them to make a few in our with difficulty and they can do it and he can only sentenceend from being able. it were great that she and although he ought not the duke and not to the nobles sentenceend of their prince of this they are of them the prince sentenceend from the nobles and although to him so great sentenceend from. he had been and the people to take them because they would become his people he should know they can only of his actions sentenceend sentencestart the people are in their soldiers for the people for him who does not to. i do well to have not the prince to keep it and not the church sentenceend of which is the other that it would to keep the people because you and in all those for long to take any way that they would and it and if in. i shall sentenceend for him so and although but let any and he had to make himself for it sentenceend sentencestart he who was able and although to have made their soldiers who had their ruin for the state of the prince. for they did not be seen the king who is not fail and if his subjects that the other hand to the church he ought the nobles ought he did sentenceend from their soldiers or by their men are so that they had to make war. and they can they can be a most for he can easily in order of the first place for this they are in our time it will make use for this reason to the prince ought sentenceend of their government to hold them sentenceend. but to make a time in our of these states that are acquired the king in italy sentenceend sentencestart but let sentenceend to keep faith of which it will see they are and as the prince so great a prince is a most by. the king and in their men and not have been long because you will only sentenceend of france was in italy has made and not fail the other by a way that he was his own sentenceend the first to be found in such. the king in the people of them he would become princes it has made their men who has the duke in order the people for many men and if you cannot defend and although the people are in the kingdom and although the nobles. i shall sentenceend to be so to be found in our and the church was in our time he will not having his state sentenceend for it and although there sentenceend in all of their soldiers to the first place he had made their. for him with a wise to keep in order that the duke had their government and it has been raised for a most to keep his actions sentenceend for this reason he would never or other to be a private that she has only to take. for his state because in a new but it sentenceend the kingdom of these sentenceend sentenceend for a private but to take the kingdom of the first and the first sentenceend of these things and he did they would be so. but they should he ought not fail of their prince is a very and they can he did that of france for his enemies of them he was able sentenceend in italy in italy with difficulty of them because it would not know there. the king louis and in their country was necessary as if the people and it sentenceend the state to hold his actions but it would and in his army to the nobles he had their captains by the state and as they are the. this they can do them as it may and if they will never be seen in his own to the king because men are found in his own to take a private to take care sentenceend sentencestart it sentenceend of their captains in a. chapter of his army to fear at the kingdom his son sentenceend to his subjects from this was born in all others that the other of others that they are not know that in order with the state that are so as if the first of. he had the nobles for his son the nobles to his friends who are not being able to have made and it will not being a prince of his subjects from those for his friends there will be more and as they did and in his men are. it is ruined because you sentenceend to his friends sentenceend of them sentenceend and they had no use for long in italy in his men who have to have done by the kingdom for this man sentenceend from those men have to. he was a few but when you for the state to the duke and the people because men have to take the state that they are and the other by one is a few sentenceend the first place he will have not the church to make and he. but it sentenceend for it to be seen because there and as it has the prince of france in order sentenceend and not to have no use with difficulty and the church by these things the prince ought in this subject in the. chapter to fear in the church with difficulty from the king louis by those who are not be considered sentenceend the kingdom for they will not be seen and as happened and they can do the prince is very necessary it. the duke with great and although to fear him to make and they can do and as a man sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend them in all their former and they had he who in their men who was able to make them in italy which is. but when these are found that are either to his own to take such things were they have need he can he was his actions the first time are so many have no longer sentenceend from being a few who has to hold him who in. it has always of a few to have to the people sentenceend sentencestart it would sentenceend sentenceend of which it is nothing but they should be considered it sentenceend of these sentenceend the state because of. therefore they should be more easily and as happened in italy has only sentenceend sentencestart for long because he did the king and they are of their states and they do you for they will not to fear at the first who. he can only when he did sentenceend them the prince ought never have a prince of his army with a very by the first is the prince of the first of france the first place for they did this subject but in all others but the. the other hand because it were in his enemies sentenceend to the kingdom in such greatness the church to him in their prince who have need to keep a few had not being considered to make a very short sentenceend from the. chapter to have a private for they were compelled sentenceend and in our to take any one of these states a few but in their soldiers sentenceend them in italy has to be found that he was a prince of these factions that. it will make a man of the duke in italy in italy with him so he can and although sentenceend to him to hold them as the first who does to take in our of the other by those to have the state by their states for long as. and they would never so long and not fail of a very and if in italy he should be found himself against himself against a time and not fail sentenceend sentencestart but he can easily sentenceend of his actions to his. chapter in italy to fear the duke di sentenceend in our and it may not the nobles you are of the people sentenceend and as is not know and he had no means he who by force to him so and the king louis sentenceend the. this is nothing so and as is that a few and they had made the king to his men are the prince should it is to have need in the people or not fail by their captains sentenceend for they will always find himself and it is. therefore that are and although the prince can to keep it sentenceend from them all his men and although he did they do because men of others but he can only be a most sentenceend the other which he would not to his. the first who is ruined by these are never been able all of the king of others that of the state which he will be so well in the prince who has been and in a new but it to make them in a private but the kingdom of the. for many and the nobles but he had not fail the kingdom and he ought above all others and to be able sentenceend to the duke di of others would in such a time in a very sentenceend sentencestart for the nobles but. but the first case in italy sentenceend sentenceend sentencestart chapter sentenceend sentencestart and if only those whom they can do this they were compelled by them as happened for they are and as if you will see of. i will make himself with a man the people in the other that the first in this that which he was his son and he would always in a prince can only are never so well sentenceend them because they would always to have to. but to the kingdom because the nobles for a time sentenceend to fear that it may rise by him and although and they should have no and it would be able and it is necessary as happened that she in such as they have a way. he was in our of these states the nobles and as happened for his men sentenceend for him who in their government to keep to him the people or not wish of his son by those who are either by these arms with his army in. for a new ones of a prince to be considered in our with his actions sentenceend and the first is nothing or the king had been a new one s for many and it will never have not know there and to fear of a way to have the. but he had he can be done of this reason sentenceend to be able sentenceend to keep it will never been considered they can rely to hold that in his state of others for his enemies they will see they are in all his. he was his friends in a man in their prince and the duke sentenceend to him to keep faith to him that in order that in this reason sentenceend to keep it was a prince and in his subjects in our and in all men to the. i consider those whom were they were of france was necessary to hold his people in their former of his army by the nobles of the king sentenceend in this is ruined to have a very in this one of these factions by their. i have had no longer of france would and they were not being a few in the church sentenceend for long as it were not fail that which are of his army of a private that which it may with his enemies for his friends as the. the duke of these are not only of their captains but they did in the king in order for it is very for the people and if any the people and they did so long as i say he did this they had made and it was one cannot defend. it would have to fear from their own to the church by them to the kingdom because the first in this subject for they were not wish it were of them and he should it will find the state that she in a private in italy. it to have the people sentenceend the people in all the state which they have to be the nobles the kingdom of others or other of others or else but when these the duke and he who had acquired by them he should know. this that he should be more powerful with their states for long and although a time sentenceend them the king he has around by their country from his actions to take the church and the first sentenceend to have a few. and they have not to the first is that in the kingdom because it may to his people and the people he did that of a most the nobles for his subjects for he was one s to hold them to him in their former by him with the. he will see they would always need for a private with his friends he ought sentenceend to have been raised and in italy to make it to keep an sentenceend to the people for the prince can be seen because there and he. and not fail and as to the duke of the kingdom sentenceend sentenceend in his actions sentenceend and if one has not have not know to hold them but let a time he should not the state and he was sent as i sentenceend the. he did sentenceend from these things which the nobles sentenceend of their captains for he would in all his friends he would sentenceend of which are found sentenceend to hold it has the people or not having a new. he will never in all men in all the king of others have a time and if only necessary of his people of france in his friends of the duke did so well to hold their ruin than the church of their prince sentenceend of a man. chapter with great that the king louis sentenceend for him for the king because it has to his friends who are and if the church but he who is a very of others have made himself the church and it will only necessary to. and they would always to fear but because you are never in such principalities that the people or other that in the duke of the people or other which they would in our of them to take the duke s and it will not the. it would have had no means sentenceend in our and as they are found so that the kingdom sentenceend in this he has to the king louis with the other by his men of others and as if it and the other that they are acquired. he who has the duke had no longer with their government of others have been and it was not fail sentenceend sentencestart but the kingdom many and in this one is a prince sentenceend them but because the first time it. this they will have not know to keep an to keep an example with the first to fear of the other of the people to make this they would not know that in this man sentenceend for his own sentenceend sentenceend in their. and if you may of a new principality the state because of their former of their country one who are of others but to hold their captains but he did the first who are never be so as it will consider those things he ought. and in order for the church to have made and it has the other to be called a few he who has acquired with him and he will never been and as to have no longer for they were in our of others would and it was his enemies. for they can rely that are acquired as the church of their former the other to make the kingdom in italy he can have no more difficult in this was one is a man will consider that she is ruined but when he did and to his. i will make a very the people to him to hold sentenceend from a private in italy in such a wise prince to the king in a few he can easily to hold him who is very necessary and if in the church which i will always need. therefore your that which a time to him the church which i consider and the kingdom many more to fear him with them and in order of france and if you and to fear of the prince of france for this was necessary for him. but let and although he had their country one of them he has been seen the kingdom in a very for many of the duke s with them and if you are in their men at his actions and he has more by the state the kingdom as they. this reason of france and he will not have not to have the nobles ought in such things to be seen that of a few he would never have a private to keep faith for him so and in all the nobles to the state of which it has. it to his actions the nobles he can easily the other hand the state and to keep a new to fear the other that which have the kingdom in his son with the prince is ruined in italy to him in all men of these states and he. but let to keep a most by his friends to the duke sentenceend them because they would become his subjects the church by his friends to him for his friends he should take a time they should know his subjects from a. this that are not be seen in our with what they have to him sentenceend of others sentenceend and it was necessary of them to him in his army by their former to be considered a prince and as it sentenceend sentenceend. and although one has more than of france in italy which he ought he will find it were compelled by their own citizens of france the duke sentenceend sentencestart the state of these sentenceend sentencestart chapter. i shall the state because of which are so long to fear but if only when one who has the kingdom his subjects are the prince so that it sentenceend sentencestart but if the prince is a prince to fear in order the first. this one can be found it is a most to him that he will see the duke did that she had he ought not know and he ought sentenceend in the nobles for many of which he had no one s and it may rise and although to fear at. for a time in such a most in italy to make him with their captains for long sentenceend from them but if he will have to his friends and if one should wish and they do them and they had not fail in a few sentenceend. he has always find and it sentenceend and to him who in their states in such princes in all of france for it would sentenceend sentenceend in italy in italy has always need for the king had the kingdom because it and. for him the other by them but it is not only are acquired with their captains and not the other that are of his people for this subject for him sentenceend sentenceend sentencestart he will find that of them and the. i wish would to him with him the people to hold it were in a private with a most the prince to make a man as the state and as they would sentenceend in their own citizens and although one should he had their men at. for it is necessary to have a wise prince to him with difficulty for he ought not have the king in the first of a private and to make them because the people and they did he should be more easily that of these. it was his son that it may with the kingdom his state the nobles you will consider the nobles but to him who in our and in such princes have to take away by him for long in the kingdom because it will see it sentenceend. but in this that it were the king sentenceend the kingdom and he can he should they can easily of france for his people because he will always the people in their men and to his son in italy in italy and if you are. but if one should know that of his own forces on their men when one who had the state sentenceend from him that of others but he would in this subject with a prince ought to hold of them and in order that a wise himself. he would never been raised and if in all that they were they can easily for many for him so that which have to him in their government to the king because of them sentenceend sentencestart chapter and it to fear to the. but he can they are never so many more by the people he was able of which will find by them in this that she was the king to be found in all that she to the king he has acquired are the other of his army with which they. chapter that they are so and although they do you to make him who has only when you may do and the people he will have done the people to fear but because of these are either sentenceend sentenceend of which they had to. it may rise of his friends to his son the prince and they had no sentenceend of these the kingdom because men are of their captains in all the nobles sentenceend for they were kept sentenceend sentenceend from the. chapter sentenceend from his army to have to keep them all things sentenceend sentencestart chapter with them all things the king to make and they were great that they had no one should not to be considered a time and. therefore your for him sentenceend sentencestart the king to make war but when they did so much better with him that it may not the other things to take them all his people and it has only when those which they had. but to make a private for a very necessary it would have a very short time are found sentenceend the king of this subject by him the duke with his son the first case he who are acquired either his friends of these are. the other which a few who were the church of their government to be done and to fear of the nobles for they should wish in our times when every and they did so long a prince should be a prince who have no sentenceend in. i wish in such greatness you and in the other that it were not know sentenceend from him sentenceend for he has made some of a man as it were compelled to hold it may and if one will see he will have a time he would. but it will have to him who were the king louis of these the other hand he would always in our and they would not only was born by him who have made a time are and as it is no longer sentenceend sentencestart the. but the king sentenceend sentenceend in order the kingdom to have been the first case sentenceend sentencestart the duke had to his men in his subjects who has around to hold sentenceend of the duke and it is nothing or. he will make the prince of which they would have had no to be more by a most to fear to hold to take up to him with him the people are so much by these are found and he has only are acquired sentenceend and not have had. the prince ought never and to make them the state that which it and if one by him to hold their country with their soldiers but because there by force sentenceend for his friends of these the people in a new. it would to have need of this is that which they are never to keep a prince sentenceend the kingdom for this they will always have to fear in our sentenceend in order that he has the state is ruined by a way to fear him. for many for it to the duke and it sentenceend sentenceend in order to the church but he has the first is no means they will not having been discussed it and it and he who are either for it may be called sentenceend in. but because you sentenceend in such principalities sentenceend and as they are in the people are of his own ability sentenceend from those whom they would be more difficult for his people or other of these two and they. and he who is not being hated by those who does and as is not being in this was born in this he who in all that in such arms against them because of these arms sentenceend from this man to him with which is that a man. i believe that it would in a private sentenceend sentencestart but the people are not having a new order for his friends in a prince sentenceend of france and they do it would in his enemies for the first case it would. the people are never or by these states are found sentenceend sentenceend and to take from a new prince and the kingdom of others would have made war sentenceend them but when it sentenceend in order of the nobles he. therefore to keep the people in a man the duke had acquired with what a new principalities that are in italy he was a man the kingdom sentenceend them the people sentenceend for a man as i consider those they would in. this that the state and if he did he ought always in order them the people and it sentenceend sentencestart chapter sentenceend for him in order and they have not having been discussed the nobles of others sentenceend. i say sentenceend sentencestart this i wish would never in italy sentenceend from being in a private but he would never have been discussed but it and if only when a way to keep a man will only necessary because there. this reason a wise prince should have done and they do and although one cannot stand sentenceend sentencestart for his enemies because you are of which i have a most to make it and not the people he can and not be able. for many and to the first in their ruin sentenceend of their former to have had been able and it would sentenceend for a new principalities are the church of france in this they will make them but he would be more. it were always have no means in order in our sentenceend of a few by these two either of this was a very necessary for long for long because that she and to fear but they should know they had the nobles but if one has. chapter with him who has to him sentenceend the first sentenceend of a time it may rise with his army by those whom there are found them sentenceend sentenceend and he should have been considered in their former of. chapter that it were of others or else of the kingdom for he did and he will only of france from the duke did not wish for his subjects that of them the people sentenceend them but to his army in all things he ought. the nobles and as they should not wish of their own will not being entirely to make it will consider his own ability it to the kingdom as happened to hold to fear to him the first to have the state which they can easily. for many years to the other to be able by one will consider of others or they had been a private that the prince sentenceend to make him in such arms he has only be seen of france from their captains in his actions for. for the prince of this they do well under his state sentenceend sentencestart it to be seen as he will see it may to take such methods with his enemies they would and he who have a prince so much the prince so he ought. and it to be found himself as i know it would become sentenceend and the kingdom of which is a most to have not wish that it and in the duke with a prince sentenceend from a man to be the other which he has only are in. therefore he did the people are found sentenceend them sentenceend the people or the nobles to make this he will never in italy sentenceend them and although the kingdom for he can be so to make use in such men who was. chapter to his army by them as it and not the nobles but let sentenceend to fear at a private by force the duke s and he will make the duke of the kingdom of these two things the prince sentenceend for the state that a. and not fail of them and not be more difficult for him with them and not know how the church of the duke and the other which it were brought and although one has made some the first in italy sentenceend to hold to him. but when these things he had their government for it to fear from him who in his people in their prince should it was his state because it will see they would have a man to his enemies of these sentenceend in this he. he will always of the people for his friends in their states in our time the church and he ought sentenceend for the kingdom of this man will only the prince to the church was sent his enemies because the duke di that. this he had their states a few to make him for long and if it is ruined but if you do because in this man of france because in the church sentenceend in all others and if only sentenceend for long for many of these are. chapter that they are not having his own ability in order sentenceend and it and although there was born for he can to keep the state to make a way and although sentenceend and it and if you may of france in his people. therefore he ought in our of others sentenceend for his men at once it may rise by them sentenceend them as i know it will consider of france for long sentenceend to make him for him the king of the state that which a. for this that they do you to make it has been in our time are never have made some have the prince sentenceend from being at once for him sentenceend of others have to be the people are found and to keep the people of. i know his state sentenceend sentenceend to have to be done and the king in this was necessary as the nobles he who has made and he can he ought in his actions because of which is a few to hold him with great but they. and to fear to him for many in all of others sentenceend and it is not be seen in all those for it to be considered and they did sentenceend sentencestart the state which it has acquired as is to be called sentenceend. this man and in all the other that in italy this subject in such greatness and the first place sentenceend of them he was necessary and in our the nobles ought always of others but the people of them but because the. chapter with what was his son with them sentenceend from this one will be the people for his people or to take away their own sentenceend sentencestart it has only those things to keep his actions of the other. and in order with them to the state which is nothing more or to keep faith by one is to keep it were always sentenceend to have had made and in this they do so and as i will consider with him the prince ought the first. i have no longer for a man to keep an and it would in this man the kingdom to him with him who were they do and he should be seen and they are the king louis of them in such a man will consider of these are so that in. therefore they can they will only of the king he has always to be a few had made war against a way you for many in their government to hold his subjects in their states a prince and not have the people to be found the. i have done sentenceend from this was the other by one who was in italy this that a new to be so well for they do you are the duke in such principalities as i will make it to be the kingdom his men have made him the. chapter for this one will find the duke had acquired with which have the duke had acquired are acquired either to take away sentenceend for long in the state is nothing sentenceend to keep it sentenceend to the nobles. he was not the nobles of others or else by a way of this was his own and not fail sentenceend to fear from them and it is nothing being able he who is very necessary of his state and in all things he will find by a wise. this he had no other things and if in their soldiers from a prince and in our and if one should have a man as it to keep his actions the duke in all his actions for it to his son the other of their captains for many and. this that he should be able they had their captains and as they will never or else for he was able he would to keep his enemies all his men in all others have had to hold it is to his enemies in order to his own arms of. therefore to him for him and as a private to have the other of the prince so well in his son with great in order to him the first place sentenceend from being entirely of this they have the prince can easily sentenceend. he who have no use for a wise to keep it is not fail of these arms with difficulty than from being well and in his son and if only the duke in all the prince should wish that they had a prince can do because in this. i wish it is ruined but the other of this that he ought above it is to have need with difficulty in our time and the king in his own and although he can and to be called and they can easily in our times when he would in. but the people sentenceend them because there by his own sentenceend and in this was the state sentenceend to make use all those things as the duke sentenceend sentencestart he was necessary and the people sentenceend. but because it to be found to fear the first to hold that she is that the nobles to fear at that it is no other hand because it will never sentenceend sentenceend and in all their country and in their own will find the. and although he did and they had acquired are found the church of a man who in the other by them but to hold their own will not be done for many and if any other by them the church but it will be a prince sentenceend in. this reason to take any of a prince is necessary as they would to make use with difficulty to him that the church to make him to keep to take them but they were brought about to keep them all the people for his men to. i have made and as a way he who by him to hold them he was necessary for they have no of others he should not to have done all other which i do well for he should have done the first in their soldiers and if it has to. the first place to fear to his enemies for he can to be done the king in this that which is ruined with him sentenceend for he will be considered the other by a few had a way they will only those men are in a most and. he can easily by a new to make him in italy and they would become to his subjects and he would to his own forces to be more to make him the people or fortune as they should be considered and to his actions of france. but he who are in our by one will always to him the king who was a few of these princes but it may not only those they were always the first time to fear but it will only necessary to his men and they would be seen. but let him and to the church with great that she in their captains and it will see his actions and if you have no to have to be the church with what should not having in such methods by those things sentenceend for his. for his actions of which i do because they are found so to the state and although but they were great men at a new but when one by his army and if they were not know and although but when they have need with great men. the king louis the kingdom of this is to fear the other to keep them to hold him that which it to keep those who by these arms in order that which they would and he has acquired and although sentenceend the people he. for his people and it were of them all that she and not be more than to make this i believe by him for the duke he can to keep to make this subject the state of which he who does one will have not fail of his people to. therefore it would to take them but he who have a prince to his army in our with their soldiers sentenceend sentenceend in our to keep those states for his subjects from this was one has around him and in his people. but to keep an sentenceend in his people or they can easily that which are and he would be able with his son in the other and not fail for him that it were always need not wish sentenceend the nobles to hold that he can. i shall have need with which have made the nobles of a prince sentenceend of them the kingdom because in his men when these things to be called to hold that the church but they were of a man to make use to have done by. this reason the other things and they will not be considered a very by him for long to have done the kingdom in his subjects sentenceend to make him with his son by these things he ought always in their country. but because that a wise because the church by him so well and the state of their states that in their states a new as is the kingdom sentenceend them but let us come but let to him sentenceend sentenceend and as a way. this subject and they have no other and not know to have done in our to him and although the state by their country one who is to make it is that which have to his state sentenceend to hold it were the kingdom as is. therefore he had a new order of a man the state because men of which he who are of his own to hold their men are in order in such arms in the church with what was able of a private for him the people to the first. chapter that she sentenceend to him who in their prince should it will never and in his state to him and as the state by those for him with their country was born but he had acquired sentenceend to the prince so great a. i sentenceend sentenceend sentenceend from him in their captains to him who was born but he had a man and as a wise himself the duke had a new prince so that a most that a new principality cannot be more easily with. and it would and although but when it and although there will only sentenceend in this was not be considered it will have to hold them in his own or to his subjects the church he who had the first sentenceend of his. the people sentenceend in all that it were in such things sentenceend them all the nobles sentenceend sentenceend for long to be a wise of these arms of their own will make it is nothing or to make the king and the king. he had their states are the first case it was not wish he did the first place he will have not know his friends of france because there and not have the nobles he has always have the nobles of others he should know. and they should he ought sentenceend of their captains that it sentenceend them but he ought above of them as a man as i have a way sentenceend them he will make war by force for long a private but he has always to keep. i do and in order and not know sentenceend the kingdom to hold sentenceend sentenceend to hold his actions and he will make a man ought always find that the duke di with a private sentenceend for a few to his actions to. this man as he did that of others he has always to hold him and if it will not be seen as the state by his subjects sentenceend the people he who has made himself as he had acquired in this was born of his enemies or by. he who is a man will always be found the other to make this he will consider as he had to hold their former and to his own or a time are and not know of his state by these factions of them because you sentenceend from. i wish it is ruined and if they did the church and if you have done and as he would not to make him and to take away their soldiers or if any and if the prince is a very of this one can they have had no use by him the. and if his army a wise that are either of them to him the other hand he would sentenceend from him in the duke with a wise he will be found and although one will find them the people in all other to keep it were great. he has more by his people in such greatness of these sentenceend to make it would become and he had made his actions to take care of which is ruined sentenceend sentencestart i know there was necessary for him. for a way he had made and although and although one will be called in the other by those of these states for a way in italy to be so to have had a new principality the prince can be found so many for many others would. he will find by those which it will not only are in their soldiers or the nobles of his state which the duke of the kingdom because men sentenceend for it has made a man as the prince of others sentenceend for he would. and as the king he will not being all others but because there sentenceend to be the nobles for he would not know that a time they had been seen in this they did that it may be more difficult by one s to be so that in. but to the other sentenceend sentenceend and as happened of their former the other things the people because in this subject and it were great a new one can to the people and in order for this man who does of which it. and not know and it was born sentenceend and he had no longer with their own forces to the state by force them and to hold his enemies of others and although the church and to hold that are of which it may not only be. it and it sentenceend of them because the people are found and the first in order them the nobles sentenceend the church and it is the other and the prince so much power they do this they can easily by their states and. therefore a prince and in a way that he should they should not being hated or fortune sentenceend sentenceend in all the king he did not having in their former with the first in his people for it is a new sentenceend. i consider with their country it were they should know and if it has more than a wise he would always have not be the king and as a time and he would become his men have to have had he had a prince sentenceend. but they are the church with difficulty of a way the other to the duke in all their states a way and if only of a new ones because it was sent by force of the state is to make himself so and they would and to take away. it will be seen a very for they are the prince so and the other that they had not be more than his enemies because he ought in his men to keep the state because that of these states of his son with his people of these. this man in this one has acquired by the first in italy for he has more than his friends as they should know that of his army was born with what he should take care the king of his army by force and they are so well in. he should be so long sentenceend and the other to his own arms sentenceend sentenceend for it were compelled the prince of his actions to fear of the duke in order for a wise he ought he was not have no longer and not. it would not being considered the prince should he has around them sentenceend from this i wish of the prince is not fail sentenceend to take any one is the nobles but because it to fear but when you sentenceend. chapter with what and the kingdom his actions of which i wish it and not have not only those which it is nothing being able he would become a very of others sentenceend the prince can only are either by these states. for the duke in such things sentenceend of the prince should he who had made some to have no longer in such as to be so long of these arms against a most the prince who is very necessary for the state by these arms from. i do because it will always in his state the church sentenceend to hold of his son and they would not the first to be found it was one will consider his enemies because there are and in all others he who does it were. i wish would and it will consider and it were great the nobles he ought the kingdom as happened and they did that they would sentenceend in italy for many of which it was the duke of a man and in our of france and not. the king louis the church sentenceend in the prince of these are acquired and the people sentenceend to the nobles you and to keep an ancient by these states and although but it is the first time they had acquired.'



## Calssification of New Sequences
we will use the random forest classifier we trained earlier to classify our newly created sequences

define a function to convery the newly created sentences into a dataframe so we can feed it to the classifier


```python
def convert_sequences_to_dataframe(text):
    columns = "sequence"
    sequences = text.split('. ')
    df_sequence = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns.split(' '),data=[s for s in sequences])
    df_book_name = pd.DataFrame(columns=['book'])
    df_output = pd.concat([df_sequence, df_book_name])
    return df_output[:-1]
```


```python
new_sherlock_df = convert_sequences_to_dataframe(sherlock_new_sentences)
new_sherlock_df['book'] = 'sherlock'
new_treasure_df = convert_sequences_to_dataframe(treasure_new_sentences)
new_treasure_df['book'] = 'treasure'
new_prince_df = convert_sequences_to_dataframe(prince_new_sentences)
new_prince_df['book'] = 'prince'

new_sentences_df = pd.concat([new_sherlock_df,new_treasure_df,new_prince_df],ignore_index=True)
```

build a matrix from the new sentences with the vocabulary of the trained classifier


```python
